# AGENTS usage for docs/

Scope
- Applies to all files under `docs/` (including `docs/manual/`).
- Repo-wide rules from the root AGENTS still apply.

Guidelines
- Keep EN/RU pairs in sync when content changes (e.g., `index.*`, `manual.*`, topic pages).
- Treat `docs/manual/*.md` as the authoritative user-facing guide; update both languages when behavior or workflows change.
- Cross-link new documents from `docs/index.*` where relevant; prefer concise, task-focused notes.
- Reuse existing scripts or commands referenced in docs instead of inventing new ones unless needed.
