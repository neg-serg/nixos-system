# Home Manager Docs Moved

All Home Manager documentation now lives in the top-level manual:
`../docs/manual/manual.en.md`. Use that file for quickstart steps, helpers,
feature flags, and GUI notes. This stub stays here so editors and tooling that
expect `home/README.md` still have a pointer to the canonical docs.
